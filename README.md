ðŸš€ Task 1 Completed: Data Pipeline Development ðŸš€
As part of my internship with Elite Tech Intern, I successfully completed Task 1, which focused on building a data pipeline for preprocessing, transformation, and loading (ETL) using Pandas and Scikit-Learn.
ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights:
Designed a pipeline to automate the ETL process.
Implemented data preprocessing & transformation techniques.
Delivered a Python script/notebook that simplifies and streamlines the workflow.
This task helped me strengthen my skills in data engineering, Python, and machine learning workflows, making data handling more efficient and production-ready.
Looking forward to the upcoming tasks and learning even more! ðŸ’¡
